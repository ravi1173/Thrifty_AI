# 🧩 Async LangGraph Conversational Agent  

This project is a **lightweight conversational agent** built with [LangGraph](https://python.langchain.com/docs/langgraph/), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), and OpenAI.  
The agent can detect user intent, route queries to the correct sub-agent, and maintain short-term memory across turns.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- 🔍 **Intent Detection** → Classifies input as **factual** or **creative**  
- 📘 **Factual Agent** → Provides concise fact-based answers  
- 🎨 **Creative Agent** → Generates imaginative responses (captions, stories, etc.)  
- 🧠 **Short-term Memory** → Keeps track of the last 2–3 turns  
- ⚡ **Async Execution** → Uses non-blocking OpenAI API calls  
- 💬 **Ongoing Conversation** → Keeps chatting until you exit
